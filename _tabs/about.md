# Hi, I'm Lukas

A security professional from Austria with a strong focus on DFIR, offensive security, and modern SOC work.

## How It Started

My path into cyber security began at an HTL for IT, where I first got in touch with networking, systems, and programming. Quite early on, I noticed that security was the area that pulled me in the most. I was fascinated by how attacks actually work, how systems can be abused, and what it really takes to detect, understand, and contain them. What started as curiosity quickly turned into a clear direction: I wanted to build a career in security.

After graduating from HTL, I spent my civil year working as a paramedic at the Red Cross. That time had a bigger impact on my work style than I expected. Being a paramedic meant dealing with stressful situations, making quick but informed decisions, communicating clearly with both colleagues and patients, and staying calm when things became chaotic. Those habits translated directly into incident response later on: when an incident happens, there is pressure, there are unknowns, and you still need to stay structured, prioritize correctly, and keep everyone aligned.

## Building a SOC – My Foundation

After my civil year, I joined a Managed Security Service Provider as a Security Analyst and helped build a 24/7 Security Operations Center from the ground up. That period became my practical foundation in security operations.

In the beginning, my day-to-day work revolved around classic SOC tasks: monitoring alerts, performing analysis and triage, and responding to incidents across different customer environments. I worked extensively with SIEM and EDR platforms such as Splunk, Cortex XDR, Defender for Endpoint, and Cybereason, investigating alerts, correlating events, and piecing together timelines to explain what really happened in each case.

Over time, my role shifted from pure alert handling toward more analytical and engineering-focused work. I spent more and more time on detection engineering and SIEM engineering: writing and improving detection rules, tuning out noise, designing meaningful use cases, and research what other logs could be useful in an efficient detection strategy. I created and maintained analyst playbooks to standardize investigations, supported new team members, and took on quality assurance responsibilities to ensure that investigations were thorough, consistent, and well-documented.

I also supported purple team activities to identify gaps in coverage, and feed these insights back into our detection lifecycle. In parallel, I started taking over customers as an account analyst, guiding them through onboarding, helping them understand what our SOC could do for them, and acting as a trusted point of contact for questions around their security posture.

That SOC work is an important part of my story, because it is the base I was and am building on - and I am curious to see where this journey goes. 

## Learning, Studying, and Certifications

Alongside my work, I am studying for a B.Sc. in Cyber Security to deepen the theoretical side of what I do. I enjoy connecting academic concepts with practical ones. 

Besides my operational work, I also lecture at WIFI in Austria, where I teach the Network Administrator and Cyber Security Expert courses. Teaching forces me to break down complex topics into something structured and practical, keeps me close to the questions and perspectives of people entering the field, reminds me where I started myself, and gives me a way to give something back to the community.

To complement both the blue and red team perspectives, I have obtained several certifications over time, including the GIAC Certified Forensic Analyst (GCFA), Practical Network Penetration Tester (PNPT) from TCM Security, Blue Team Level 1 and Blue Team Level 2 from Security Blue Team, and the Palo Alto Certified Detection and Remediation Analyst. They reflect my interest in understanding both how attackers think and how defenders can respond effectively.

## How I Think About Security

In general, I like operating in the space between offense and defense: designing and executing offensive techniques and attack paths, then translating those techniques into concrete detections, implementing them in SIEM or EDR, and validating that they actually work under real conditions. DFIR, threat hunting, SIEM engineering, red teaming, and pentesting are all parts of the same picture for me rather than separate boxes.

I enjoy turning noisy, unstructured data into a clear narrative – figuring out which signals matter, reconstructing the “movie” of an incident or assessment, and telling that story in a way that is understandable for both technical teams and non-technical stakeholders. Long term, I do not want to choose between pentesting and DFIR; I want to stay active in both and let them inform each other.

## About This Blog

This blog is where I tie all of this together. I use it to share my thoughts on security, DFIR, offensive techniques, and SOC and IR work in general, but also to write about my personal experiences, my studies, and what I learn from day-to-day practice. Sometimes that means breaking down a specific technique, case, or tool; sometimes it means reflecting on processes, collaboration, or how to grow in the field.

My goal is not to present theory in a polished way, but to document real learnings, mistakes, and insights as they happen. If you are interested in DFIR, SOC operations, offensive security, or you are just starting your own journey in cyber security and wondering what the work actually looks like, I hope this space gives you something useful, relatable, and honest about where I come from and where I am going.
